# `tasit-contracts`

This package contains the smart contracts (and tests, etc.) from a few of the most popular dapps.

`tasit-contracts` contains a collection of the latest smart contracts from major projects that could be a useful standalone utility even when used outside of the context of the Tasit SDK. Other developers could use this package for testing their own libraries too.

Most of the details are in the main README for the monorepo [here](https://github.com/tasitlabs/TasitSDK/blob/develop/README.md).
