# `tasit-identity-contract`

This package helps with onboarding a user using a smart-contract-based identity. Examples of such smart-contract-based identities include the [Gnosis Safe](https://safe.gnosis.io/) and [universal login](https://universallogin.io/).

Most of the details are in the main README for the monorepo [here](https://github.com/tasitlabs/TasitSDK/blob/develop/README.md)
